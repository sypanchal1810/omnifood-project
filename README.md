## About Omnifood

We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being
through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and
friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for
cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. We want
to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to
select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will
create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We
partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver
all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be
packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving
one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
